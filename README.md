# MATH4992

There are two pdf files for two main algorithms Merge_Stego and Extract_Stego mentioned in the report. 
Feel free to check them if you want to know about the details of these two algorithms

Also,
There are two zip files. 
The Algorithm1.zip is the program of Algorithm 1 mentioned in the report.
The Algorithm2.zip is the program of Advanced Algorithm 2 mentioned in the report.

In each of the zip file, there will be a Readme.txt. Please read it before you use the Programs.

The Algorithm1 and Algorithm2 can be executed in MATLAB. Feel free to try for them in MATLAB.

Thank you.
